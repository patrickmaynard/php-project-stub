# PHP project stub
A basic scaffolding on which to build PHP projects using composer and a simple folder structure.

To set things up, run `make init`.

To test the basics, run `php smoketest.php`.

TODO: Add PHPUnit tests and a simple Makefile target for running them, along with a basic settings.yaml file.
