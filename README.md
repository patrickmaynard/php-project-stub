# PHP project stub
A basic scaffolding on which to build PHP projects using composer and a simple folder structure.

* To set things up, run `make init`.
* To make the database connection work, update config/settings.yaml.
* To test the basics, run `php smoketest.php`.

TODOs: 

* Add a `public` folder
* Add PHPUnit tests and a simple Makefile target for running them. 
* Add a RECIPES.md file for stuff like copying the project to a new github repository.
